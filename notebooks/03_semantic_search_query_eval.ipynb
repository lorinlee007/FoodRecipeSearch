    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Summary of FAISS Behavior\n",
    "- FAISS focuses on **courgette / tomato / cheese / baked** patterns but often ignores the **“pasta”** constraint.\n",
    "- Top-2 hits (**clafouti**, **frittata**) are vegetable/egg bakes with courgette and cheese, but **no pasta at all**.\n",
    "- Rank 3 is a good semantic hit for a **courgette pasta** dish (courgette + pasta + parmesan), but lacks tomato and “bake”.\n",
    "- Rank 4 is a **beef pasta bake** (pasta + tomato sauce + ricotta + mozzarella) that matches the *pasta bake + tomato + cheese* structure, but misses courgette.\n",
    "- Rank 5 is a **courgette bake** (courgette + tomato + cheese, baked) but again **no pasta**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, FAISS is picking up the *general flavor* (courgette + tomato + cheese + baked) and sometimes the *pasta bake* idea, but it doesn’t reliably enforce the requirement that this is a **courgette pasta bake**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Summary of BM25 Behavior\n",
    "- BM25 emphasizes exact word matches on **“courgette”**, **“pasta”**, **“tomato”**, and **“cheese”**.\n",
    "- Rank 1 is almost a perfect match in spirit: a **pasta with tomato courgette and garlic** plus parmesan.\n",
    "- Rank 4 is explicitly a **pasta bake with goats cheese**, containing pasta, courgette, aubergines, and cherry tomatoes.\n",
    "- Rank 5 is the same **courgette pasta** dish that FAISS surfaced.\n",
    "- Some entries (like the pure courgette bake or clafouti) still lack pasta, but overall BM25 surfaces **more true pasta dishes** in the top 5 than FAISS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, BM25 does a better job here of respecting the **“pasta” and “pasta bake”** structure while still keeping courgette / tomato / cheese in the picture.\n",

    "- Ranks 2 and 3 include yogurt / milk → **not allowed**.\n",
    "- Ranks 4 and 5 contain **eggs** → strongly incorrect.\n",
    "- Overall: FAISS detects “high-protein breakfast” well but **fails hard on the dietary restriction**, producing only **1 correct hit**.\n",

    "## 🎯 Summary of BM25 Behavior\n",
    "- BM25 fixates on **\"high-protein breakfast\"** and **completely ignores** “no eggs” and “no dairy.”\n",
    "- All 5 BM25 hits contain egg and/or dairy multiple times.\n",

    "- FAISS partially picks up on **“vegetarian”** and **“quick dinner”**, but is noisy:\n",
    "  - **Rank 1 – fast n tasty mini meatloaves** → uses **ground beef** → completely violates “vegetarian.”\n",
    "  - **Rank 2 – southwest vegetarian bake** → vegetarian, but a **heavy baked rice–bean–cheese casserole**, not really “not too heavy,” and not especially quick.\n",
    "  - **Rank 3 – easy vegetarian gravy** → vegetarian but just a **sauce**, not a full dinner.\n",
    "  - **Rank 4 – easy pizza casserole** → vegetarian but a **rich casserole**; heavier and 60-min style rather than quick/light.\n",
    "  - **Rank 5 – quick vegetarian taco salad** → actually matches: quick, vegetarian, salad-style main that’s relatively light.\n",
    "- Overall: FAISS understands *vegetarian* and *dinner-ish comfort*, but:\n",
    "  - Misses the **vegetarian constraint** at rank 1.\n",

    "  - **Rank 1 – linguine with sweet pepper sauce**  \n",
    "    - Tagged as a *quick vegetarian dinner*, 30 minutes, pasta + veggies → good match, reasonably light.\n",
    "  - **Rank 2 – zucchini pasta**  \n",

    "    - Vegetarian, 30 minutes, soup main → plausible light-ish dinner (depends on portion, but fits better than heavy casseroles).\n",
    "  - **Rank 4 – 8 minute creamy tomato soup**  \n",
    "    - Uses **chicken stock**, so **not vegetarian** → violates constraint.\n",
    "  - **Rank 5 – ten minute eggplant parmigiana**  \n",
