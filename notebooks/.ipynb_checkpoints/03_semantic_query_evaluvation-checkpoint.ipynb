       "  'description': \"i named this a winter's walk beef stew, as it is just the kind of hearty and welcoming meal to come back to after a cold and energetic winter's walk! the dumplings are baked for the last 20 minutes on top of the stew and are deliciously crisp and golden, but still fluffy and light underneath. this can be made with minced beef/ground beef as well as braising/stewing steak or chuck steak. i have allowed 2 dumplings per person here - please adapt the quantities to suit, but we always find 2 dumplings each very satisfying! there is no need to serve much else with this filling comforting stew, maybe some steamed cabbage, baby potatoes or greens would be nice.....or a few extra carrots. this serves 4 people with very generous helpings. you may need a walk afterwards!! a nice glass of robust red wine or a pint of ale would be great accompaniments! this can be made in a crockpot - up to the dumpling stage and then the stew can be put into an ovenproof dish and baked with the dumplings. likewise, if you are going for a pre-dinner walk - make the stew right up to the dumpling stage, and then finish off when you get home.\",\n",
